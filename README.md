# 🏦 Bank Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Bank Analytics Project** focuses on analyzing customer banking activities using transactional and loan datasets. The project aims to uncover insights into customer financial behavior, loan distribution, transaction patterns, and overall banking performance through data analytics and interactive dashboards.

This project integrates **Excel, MySQL, Power BI, and Tableau** to convert raw banking data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and dashboard creation  
- **MySQL** – Querying transaction and loan datasets  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and KPI analysis  
- **Tableau** – Advanced visualizations and storytelling dashboards  

---

## 📊 Datasets Used
1. **Customer Transaction Dataset**
   - Debit transactions
   - Credit transactions
   - Transaction methods and risk indicators  

2. **Loan Dataset**
   - Loan applications
   - Disbursement details
   - Interest rates
   - Repayment and collection data

## ❓ Problem Statement
Banks generate massive volumes of transaction and loan data daily, but much of this data remains underutilized due to:
- Difficulty in tracking debit and credit patterns  
- Lack of unified analysis of loan and transaction data  
- Limited insights from raw SQL query outputs  
- Absence of interactive dashboards for decision-making  
- Challenges in identifying key KPIs for growth and risk assessment  

This project addresses these challenges by integrating analytics and visualization tools to deliver meaningful, real-time insights. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
